# SonicWall Global Online

Welcome to the official SonicWall Global Online code repository.

This is where all major code changes happen before putting it into Oasis CMS. The idea is that we can successfully version-control all of our work and also make it much easier to do code reviews. 

You DO NOT need to use Github for updating small content changes in Oasis-- although you are always more than welcome use GitHub as a place to store your code for version control and review.

For example, text changes, new/replacing images, SEO changes, operational changes, and creating new pages using standard templates. We will continue to still use Oasis for those requests without the need to use GitHub.


///WEBDEV TEAM WORKFLOW:///

1). Oasis ticket request gets created that asks for web developement work.

2). IMPORTANT: Assigned webdev identifies which files in the Github repository need to be edited, and creates a NEW branch. (unless you  already have a designated branch). Always make sure you are editing in the right branch.

3). Edit the code in YOUR designated branch. ALWAYS add a comment for each change or new file-- no matter how little the change is.

4). When the code work is done, create a PULL REQUEST.

5). Update your Oasis ticket as Ready for review

6). Another team member will be assigned the task to do CODE REVIEW on your PR.

7). Once the PULL REQUEST has been verified as working and correct, the reviewer will decide whether or not to MERGE your changes into the branch. (Not the MASTER BRANCH, yet!)

8). Once all code changes are ready in YOUR branch and we're ready for deployement, create a request to merge YOUR branch with the MASTER BRANCH.

9). Team Lead will will decide whether or not to merge YOUR branch into the MASTER BRANCH.

10). Team Lead merges into Master and then deploys code into ROOT DIRECTORY.

11). Team Lead initiates manual deployment through Oasis.
